install: 'The *job-executor-service* can be installed as a part of [Keptn''s uniform](https://keptn.sh).


  ### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster


  To deploy the current version of the *job-executor-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes
  cluster, apply

  the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:


  ```console

  kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml

  ```


  This should install the `job-executor-service` together with a Keptn `distributor`
  into the `keptn` namespace, which you

  can verify using


  ```console

  kubectl -n keptn get deployment job-executor-service -o wide

  kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=job-executor-service

  ```


  ### Up- or Downgrading


  Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed
  version (specified by

  the `$VERSION` placeholder):


  ```console

  kubectl -n keptn set image deployment/job-executor-service job-executor-service=keptnsandbox/job-executor-service:$VERSION
  --record

  ```


  ### Uninstall


  To delete a deployed *job-executor-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files
  from this repository and delete the

  Kubernetes resources:


  ```console

  kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml

  ```
