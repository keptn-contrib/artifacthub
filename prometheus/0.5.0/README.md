The *prometheus-service* is a [Keptn](https://keptn.sh) service that is responsible for

1. configuring Prometheus for monitoring services managed by Keptn, and
1. receiving alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager and translating the alert payload to a cloud event that is sent to the Keptn eventbroker.

## Setup Prometheus Monitoring

Keptn doesn't install or manage Prometheus and its components. Users need to install Prometheus and Prometheus Alert manager as a prerequisite.

Some environment variables have to set up in the prometheus-service deployment
```yaml
    # Prometheus installed namespace
    - name: PROMETHEUS_NS
      value: 'default'
    # Prometheus server configmap name
    - name: PROMETHEUS_CM
      value: 'prometheus-server'
    # Prometheus server app labels
    - name: PROMETHEUS_LABELS
      value: 'component=server'
    # Prometheus configmap data's config filename
    - name: PROMETHEUS_CONFIG_FILENAME
      value: 'prometheus.yml'
    # AlertManager configmap data's config filename
    - name: ALERT_MANAGER_CONFIG_FILENAME
      value: 'alertmanager.yml'
    # Alert Manager config map name
    - name: ALERT_MANAGER_CM
      value: 'prometheus-alertmanager'
    # Alert Manager app labels
    - name: ALERT_MANAGER_LABELS
      value: 'component=alertmanager'
    # Alert Manager installed namespace
    - name: ALERT_MANAGER_NS
      value: 'default'
    # Alert Manager template configmap name
    - name: ALERT_MANAGER_TEMPLATE_CM
      value: 'alertmanager-templates'
```

### Execute the following steps to install prometheus-service

* Download the Keptn's Prometheus service manifest
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/prometheus-service/release-0.4.0/deploy/service.yaml
```

* Replace the environment variable value according to the use case and apply the manifest
```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

* Install Role and Rolebinding to permit Keptn's prometheus-service for performing operations in the Prometheus installed namespace.
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/prometheus-service/release-0.4.0/deploy/role.yaml -n <PROMETHEUS_NS>
```

* Execute the following command to install Prometheus and set up the rules for the *Prometheus Alerting Manager*:
```bash
keptn configure monitoring prometheus --project=sockshop --service=carts
```

### Optional: Verify Prometheus setup in your cluster

* To verify that the Prometheus scrape jobs are correctly set up, you can access Prometheus by enabling port-forwarding for the prometheus-server:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 8080 -n <PROMETHEUS_NS>
```

Prometheus is then available on [localhost:8080/targets](http://localhost:8080/targets) where you can see the targets for the service.
