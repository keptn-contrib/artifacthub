[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/keptn-contrib/argo-service)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/keptn-contrib/argo-service)

The Argo Service promotes [Argo rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/), which have been tested and evaluated with Keptn.
Therefore, this service listens on `sh.keptn.events.evaluation-done` events and depending on the evaluation result
*promotes* or *aborts* a rollout.
This Argo Service derives the name of the rollout as well as the namespace from the service, stage, and project infos contained in the event.
More precisely, the rollout name is composed of `service`-`stage`
and the namespace is composed of `project`-`stage`.
