install: "# Installation\n\nThe dynatrace-service can be installed in three steps:\n\
  \n## 1. Download the latest dynatrace-service Helm chart\n\nDownload [the latest\
  \ dynatrace-service Helm chart](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/releases/latest/)\
  \ from GitHub. Please ensure that the version of the dynatrace-service is compatible\
  \ with the version of Keptn you have installed by consulting the [Compatibility\
  \ Matrix](compatibility.md). Details on installing or upgrading Keptn can be found\
  \ on the [Keptn website](https://keptn.sh/docs/quickstart/).\n\n## 2. Gather Keptn\
  \ credentials\n\nThe dynatrace-service requires access to the Keptn API consisting\
  \ of `KEPTN_API_URL`, `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` and optionally `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL`.\n\n*\
  \ To get the values for `KEPTN_API_URL` (also known as `KEPTN_ENDPOINT`), please\
  \ see [Authenticate Keptn CLI](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.16.x/operate/install/#authenticate-keptn-cli).\n\
  \n* By default, the `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` is read from the `keptn-api-token` secret\
  \ (i.e., the secret from the control-plane) and does not need to be set during installation.\n\
  \n* If you would like to use backlinks from your Dynatrace tenant to the Keptn Bridge,\
  \ provide the service with `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL`. For further details about this value,\
  \ please see [Authenticate Keptn Bridge](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.16.x/operate/install/#authenticate-keptn-bridge).\n\
  \nIf running on a Linux or Unix based system, you can assign these to environment\
  \ variables to simplify the installation process: \n\n```console\nKEPTN_API_URL=<KEPTN_API_URL>\n\
  KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL=<KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL> # optional\n```\n\nAlternatively, replace the\
  \ variables with the actual values in the `helm upgrade` command in the following\
  \ section.\n\n\n## 3. Install the dynatrace-service\n\nTo install the dynatrace-service\
  \ in the standard `keptn` namespace, execute:\n\n```console\nhelm upgrade --install\
  \ dynatrace-service -n keptn \\\n    <HELM_CHART_FILENAME> \\\n    --set dynatraceService.config.keptnApiUrl=$KEPTN_API_URL\
  \ \\\n    --set dynatraceService.config.keptnBridgeUrl=$KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL\n```\n\n\
  **Note:** \n- You can select additional installation options by appending key-value\
  \ pairs with the syntax `--set key=value`.\n"
