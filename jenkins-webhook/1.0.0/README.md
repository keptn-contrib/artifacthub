# Jenkins Webhook Integration

- Using Keptn version 0.10.* to 0.12.x? Use the [Keptn Jenkins Shared Library](https://artifacthub.io/packages/keptn/keptn-integrations/jenkins-library).
- Using a Keptn version above 0.12.x? Use this integration method.

Keptn versions over 0.12.x include the webhook service as standard. Use this to trigger Jenkins either asynchronously with no changes required to your Jenkins job. 

Alternatively trigger Jenkins synchronously with one change to the job.

This video explains both asynchronous and synchronous methods:
