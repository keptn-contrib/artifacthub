  # Keptn Zapier Integration

  ## Usage: Zapier Responds to Keptn

  Create a Zap that uses Webhooks by Zapier to run whatever Zap you want.

  Then configure the Keptn webhook service to listen for the event you wish to react on (eg. `mysequence.finished` event)

  When the Keptn sequence (or task) has completed, Keptn will trigger a webhook into Zapier, and the Zap will execute.

  ## Usage: Zapier Trigger Keptn
  Zapier can also trigger Keptn sequences. At the end of a Zap, place an outgoing Webhook which fires an event to the Keptn `/api/v1/event` endpoint.
  Use a valid `.triggered` cloud event (see below) and Keptn will start your sequence.

  ```
  curl -X POST https://example.com/api/v1/event
  --header "x-token": "<KeptnAPIToken>"
  {
    "data": {
      "project": "<KeptnProjectName>",
      "service": "<KeptnServiceName>",
      "stage": "<KeptnStageName>"
    },
    "source": "zapier",
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "type": "sh.keptn.event.<KeptnStageName>.<KeptnSequenceName>.triggered"
  }
  ```

  ## Usage: Do Both
  Of course it is possible to use Zapier on both inputs and outputs.

  ### Example: Send an Email, Trigger a Sequence, Receive Results back via Email
  Create 2 zaps.

  - The first Zap lets you email Zapier with a formatted email. It then parses the email for Keptn details and triggers a sequence (using the Keptn API webhook).
  - The second Zap relies on the Keptn webhook service listening for whatever event you like, the zap takes that payload and emails it to you.
