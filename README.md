# Artifact Integration

This repository holds the metadata for Keptn integrations to be listed on the [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io). Each Keptn integration listed needs to have an [`artifacthub-pkg.yml` file](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/metadata/artifacthub-pkg.yml) and a `README.md` file.

To be listed on the [Keptn docs integration page](https://keptn.sh/docs/integrations/), you must raise a PR is this repository.
