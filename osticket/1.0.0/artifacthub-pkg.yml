    # Keptn osTicket Integration

  osTicket is a popular open source ticketing system. Using the Keptn webhook-service it is possible to create tickets in osTicket from Keptn events.

  ## Step 1: Create osTicket API key

  Go to the osTicket Staff Control Panel and generate an API Key: `https://example.com/scp/apikeys.php`

  Note that for tickets to be created, the IP address of the submitter (ie. Keptn) must be listed in the API key. Give your API key `Can Create Tickets` permission.

  Save this API key as a Keptn secret:

  ## Step 2: Configure Webhook Service

  The osTicket endpoint to create tickets is a `POST` to `https://example.com/api/tickets.json`

  You must add the `x-api-key` header.

  A raw `curl` request would look like this:

  ```
  curl -X POST 'http://example.com/api/tickets.json' \
    -H 'x-api-key: <OSTICKET_API_TOKEN_HERE>' \
    --data-raw '{
      "source": "API",
      "name": "Angry User",
      "email": "api@osticket.com",
      "phone": "12345678",
      "subject": "Keptn: Testing API",
      "message": "Ticket content here..."
    }'
  ```

  Create that in the webhook UI:

  Execute a Keptn sequence and you should receive a ticket.

  ## Troubleshooting
  The most common issue is that the IP address of the sender (ie. Keptn) doesn't match the IP that osTicket allows to create tickets. Ensure the Keptn IP and the IP you have entered during API key creation match. There is no way to use domain names instead of IPs. This is an osTicket limitation, not a Keptn limitation.
