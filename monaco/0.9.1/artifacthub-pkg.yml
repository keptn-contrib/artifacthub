  ## Installation

  The *monaco-service* can be installed as a part of [Keptn's uniform](https://keptn.sh).

  ### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster

  To deploy the current version of the *monaco-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes cluster, apply the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```

  This should install the `monaco-service` together with a Keptn `distributor` into the `keptn` namespace, which you can verify using

  ```console
  kubectl -n keptn get deployment monaco-service -o wide
  kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=monaco-service
  ```

  ### Up- or Downgrading

  Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed version (specified by the `$VERSION` placeholder):

  ```console
  kubectl -n keptn set image deployment/monaco-service monaco-service=keptnsandbox/monaco-service:$VERSION --record
  ```

  ### Uninstall

  To delete a deployed *monaco-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files from this repository and delete the Kubernetes resources:

  ```console
  kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```
