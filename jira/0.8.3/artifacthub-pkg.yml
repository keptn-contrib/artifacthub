install: '## Installation


  The *jira-service* can be installed as a part of [Keptn''s uniform](https://keptn.sh).


  Do not deploy from `master` branch. Please switch to the release branch that matches
  your Keptn version.


  ### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster


  To deploy the current version of the *jira-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes cluster,
  apply the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:


  ```console

  kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml

  ```


  This should install the `jira-service` together with a Keptn `distributor` into
  the `keptn` namespace, which you can verify using


  ```console

  kubectl -n keptn get deployment jira-service -o wide

  kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=jira-service

  ```


  ### Logs

  Retrieve container logs with:


  ```

  kubectl logs -n keptn -l run=jira-service -c jira-service

  ```


  Retrieve distributor logs with:

  ```

  kubectl logs -n keptn -l run=jira-service -c distributor

  ```


  ### Up- or Downgrading


  Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed
  version (specified by the `$VERSION` placeholder):


  ```console

  kubectl -n keptn set image deployment/jira-service jira-service=keptnsandbox/jira-service:$VERSION
  --record

  ```


  ### Uninstall


  To delete a deployed *jira-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files from this
  repository and delete the Kubernetes resources:


  ```console

  kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml

  ```
