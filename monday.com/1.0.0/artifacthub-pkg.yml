  # Monday.com Integration

  Create Monday.com Items from Keptn

  ## Step 1: Gather Monday.com Details
  1. Go to Monday.com and copy your Personal API token. "User Circle Icon" > Admin > API
  
  ![monday.com api](/assets/1.png)

  2. Go to your board and make a note of the board ID from the url:

  ![monday.com board id](/assets/2.png)

  3. Each "group" of items in the UI has a unique ID.
  Use the Monday API to get the `id` of the group where you want to create items.

  ```
  MONDAY_API_TOKEN=<YOUR-API-TOKEN>
  MONDAY_BOARD_ID=<YOUR-BOARD-ID>
  curl --location --request POST "https://api.monday.com/v2" \
  --header "Authorization: $MONDAY_API_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-raw "{\"query\":\"query { boards (ids: $MONDAY_BOARD_ID) { groups { id title}} }\",\"variables\":{}}"
  ```

  The output should look like this. Here you need to use either `topics` and `group_title`.
  ```
  { 
    "data":{
      "boards":[{
        "groups":[{
          "id":"topics",
          "title":"Group Title"
        }, {
          "id":"group_title",
          "title":"Group Title 2"
        }]
      }]
    },
    "account_id":12345678
  }
  ```

  ## Step 2: Save Secrets
  Save each of the items above into a Keptn secret making sure to set the `scope` as `keptn-webhook-service`

  ## Step 3: Configure Webhook

  1. Subscribe to whatever task and task suffix you wish
  2. Set the Request Method to `POST`
  3. Set the URL as: `https://api.monday.com/v2`
  4. Add 2 headers: `Authorization` and `Content-Type`
  5. Set `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
  6. Set `Authorization` to your Monday.com API token (eg. `{{.secret.monday-details.api_token}}`)
  7. Set the body as below:

  ```
  {
  "query": "mutation {create_item(board_id: <YOUR-BOARD-ID>, group_id: <YOUR-GROUP-IP>, item_name: \"My Item Title Here...\") { id }}",
  "variables": {}
  }
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  {
  "query": "mutation {create_item(board_id: {{.secret.monday-details.board_id}}, group_id: {{.secret.monday-details.group_id}}, item_name: \"My Item Title Here...\") { id }}",
  "variables": {}
  }
  ```

  ## Output
  Your Monday.com item will be created. You can also use variables from the previous Keptn events such as the project `{{ .data.project }}`, service `{{ .data.service }}`, stage `{{ .data.stage }}` or any other content you need to send to Monday.com (such as quality gate evalution results).
