  ## Installation

  ### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster

  To deploy the current version of the *onechart-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes cluster, apply the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```

  This should install the `onechart-service` together with a Keptn `distributor` into the `keptn` namespace, which you can verify using

  ```console
  kubectl -n keptn get deployment onechart-service
  kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=onechart-service
  ```

  ### Uninstall

  To delete a deployed *onechart-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files from this repository and delete the Kubernetes resources:

  ```console
  kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml
  ```
