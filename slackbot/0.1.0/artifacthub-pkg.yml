install: "1. Create a **[classic Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1)**\
  \ and give it a name, e.g., **Keptn-App** and select the development slack workspace.\n\
  \n1. In the next screen, add bot to the app. \n\n    ![add bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/add-bot.png)\n\
  \n1. Add a legacy bot user to the bot. \n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/add-legacy-bot-user.png)\n\
  \n1. Give the Bot a name, e.g, **Keptn**. \n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/add-bot-user.png)\n\
  \n1. Click on **Install App** in the left menu and **Install App to Workspace**.\
  \ \n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/install-app.png)\n\
  \n1. Confirm the next dialog.\n\n1. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Access Token** as\
  \ we will need it later. \n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/copy-bot-token.png)\n\
  \n1. We are finished with this integration by now. However, we need to change some\
  \ settings later, so pleae keep this browser open.\n\n1. Go to your Slack workspace\
  \ and create a new channel that will receive the approval notifications. You can\
  \ name it, e.g., **Keptn-approvals**. \n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-sandbox/slackbot-service/master/images/add-slack-channel.png)\n\
  \n1. Add the app to the channel by clicking on **Add an app** and select the newly\
  \ created app from the list.\n\n1. In the left menu of Slack right-click on the\
  \ channel that you just created and click on **Copy link**. Open this link in a\
  \ browser or paste it into a textfile as we will need the channel ID for the integration\
  \ to work. \n\n1. The link will look similar to *https://your-workspace.slack.com/archives/C018WDNTZKN*\
  \ - please copy the last part of the URL after the last `/` as this is the channel\
  \ ID that we'll need in a minute. In this example the channel ID is `C018WDNTZKN`.\n"
